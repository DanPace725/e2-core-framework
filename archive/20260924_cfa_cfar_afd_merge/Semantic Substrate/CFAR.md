## CFAR Framework Summary

**CFAR** stands for **Constraint-Fluctuation-Attention-Resolution** - a practical framework for matching problem resolution to system capacity.

### Core Concept

The CFAR Framework is built on the insight that many systems fail because they try to "print" patterns finer than the system can actually resolve. Drawing inspiration from optics (like the Rayleigh criterion that limits optical resolution), it applies this principle to incentives and cognition.

**Key Paradigm**: optics → incentives → cognition (Rayleigh analogies)

### Theoretical Foundation

The framework models system behavior using three core variables:

- **C (Constraint)**: System structure and institutional inertia
- **F (Fluctuation)**: Designed variance and gradient engineering
- **A (Attention)**: Energy flow and cognitive resources

These interact through mathematical differential equations:

- dC/dt = αC·C(1-C) - βCF·C·F - γCA·C·A + uC(t)
- dF/dt = αF·F(1-F) - βFC·F·C + γFA·F·A + uF(t)
- dA/dt = αA·A(1-A) + βAC·A·C + βAF·A·F + uA(t)

### Technical Implementation

**Control Architecture**: The system uses a sophisticated dual-controller approach:

1. **PID Controller** (slow/medium levers): For structural adjustments when precision is possible
2. **Bandit Algorithms** (fast levers): For rapid interventions and exploration
3. **Fluctuation Controller**: For engineered gradient creation when precision is blocked
4. **Guardrails**: Safety and constraint enforcement systems

**Strategy Switching**: The system automatically switches between:

- **Precision Mode [P]**: Fine structural adjustments via PID when resolution allows
- **Fluctuation Mode [F]**: Gradient engineering when precision is blocked by the Rayleigh criterion

### Practical Applications

The framework comes with:

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit-based UI for real-time simulation and visualization
- **REST API**: For integrations and automation
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools for running simulations
- **Example Configurations**: Including a littering reduction system

The system can model and optimize various behavior change scenarios like:

- Littering reduction programs
- Seatbelt usage campaigns
- Organizational transformation
- Policy implementation

### Key Innovation

Rather than relying solely on money-based incentives, CFAR achieves **stable behavior change** by:

1. Respecting natural resolution limits (like the Rayleigh criterion in optics)
2. Using fluctuation control when precision is blocked
3. Automatically detecting attention traps and system stalls
4. Providing alternative pathways when direct approaches fail

The framework represents a bridge between complex systems theory and practical intervention design, making sophisticated relational complexity theory actionable for real-world systems analysis and intervention.

**Outcome**: Stable behavior change without relying exclusively on money-only incentives, achieved through intelligent matching of intervention strategies to system capacity and resolution limits.

## **Glossary**

A working vocabulary for the **CFAR Framework** (Constraint-Fluctuation-Attention-Resolution).

This is a living document — extend it as concepts evolve.

**Core Concepts**

**Constraint (C)**

Structural limits and affordances that shape behavior. Includes rules, laws, default settings, design features, enforcement presence.

*Analogous to:* viscosity or channel walls in fluid dynamics; aperture stop in optics.

**Fluctuation (F)**

Variability, randomness, and turbulence in the system. Can be noise, novelty, exploration, or instability.

*Analogous to:* turbulence in fluids; stochastic jitter in signals.

**Attention (A)**

Salience and amplification of norms, signals, and cues. Campaigns, prompts, media visibility, and social proof.

*Analogous to:* light intensity or pressure driving flow.

**Norm (N)**

Shared belief or expectation about how others behave. Updates dynamically based on observed outcomes.

**Burden (B)**

Perceived cost, hassle, or fatigue associated with interventions. Rising burden predicts backlash or dropout.

---

**Resolution Analogies**

**Rayleigh Criterion**

In optics: the minimum resolvable feature size is proportional to wavelength / numerical aperture.

In social systems: the minimum resolvable change is proportional to intervention granularity / sensing-actuation capacity.

**ΔY_min (Minimum Resolvable Change)**

The smallest reliable shift in outcome the system can detect and control.

[ \Delta Y_{\min} \approx k_1 \cdot \frac{\lambda_{\text{eff}}}{\mathrm{NA}_{\text{eff}}} ]

**Numerical Aperture (NA_eff)**

Effective “aperture” of the system: how finely it can sense (data richness, feedback speed) and act (number + precision of levers).

**λ_eff (Effective Wavelength)**

Granularity and cadence of interventions. Longer λ = broad campaigns; shorter λ = micro-timed, targeted pulses.

**k₁ (Process Factor)**

Slack variable capturing unpredictability: habituation, operational variance, residual model error.

**Depth of Focus (DOF)**

Robustness margin of an intervention. High NA improves resolution but narrows tolerance to drift, just as in optics.

---

**Control Architecture**

**PID Controller**

Proportional–Integral–Derivative control loop applied to medium/slow levers (laws, defaults, infrastructure).

- P: respond to error immediately.
- I: accumulate error and correct drift.
- D: damp overshoot and oscillation.

**Multi-Armed Bandit**

Adaptive algorithm for fast levers (messages, prompts, channels). Balances exploration vs. exploitation to avoid habituation.

**Guardrails**

Automatic checks for equity gaps, burden thresholds, cost ceilings, or oscillatory instability. Trigger rollback or pause if exceeded.

**Deadband**

Range of error around the target in which the controller takes no action, preventing thrash.

**Hysteresis**

Intentional lag in switching direction to avoid flip-flopping behavior.

**Change Budget**

Maximum allowed adjustment per cycle. Ensures stability and prevents overwhelming users or operations.

RFC (Request for Comments)

Purpose: a structured proposal for a new idea, feature, or change.

Format: usually a markdown doc with background, motivation, design details, pros/cons, and open questions.

Workflow:

Someone writes an RFC draft.

It’s circulated for review/discussion (“request for comments”).

After feedback, the team accepts/rejects/archives it.

Think of RFCs as living proposals — the place where exploration and debate happens before implementation.

ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

Purpose: a permanent record of a design or architecture choice that has been made.

Format: very short markdown doc (~1 page), usually with these sections:

Context

Decision

Status (accepted, superseded, deprecated)

Consequences (positive and negative)

Workflow:

Once an RFC or discussion resolves into a final decision, you capture it as an ADR.

Think of ADRs as committed history — the logbook of why the system looks the way it does.

**Meta Concepts**

**Cognitive Resolution**

The limit of human/group capacity to meaningfully process complexity. If a problem is scoped finer than this limit, participation degrades into disengagement or oversimplification.

**Cognitive Bandwidth Matcher**

A scoping tool that decomposes problems to match group capacity, surfaces only resolvable units, and shows connections to larger patterns.

**CFAR Framework**

The Constraint-Fluctuation-Attention-Resolution paradigm: design problems and interventions so they respect the system's resolution limits (optical, social, cognitive).
